## APPROACH

The approach adopted is as follows:

1. A pseudocode was developed in a rough sketch, itemizing the concepts, fuctions, the variables and how they will beconsumed.
2. The base HTML pages are coded.
3. Basic styling was applied to differentiate the codes.
4. API targets and frameworks were identified and applied
5. Tags are applied to each object/element that needs to be targeted to achieve a particular feature.
6. Each base function was coded using Javascript and JQUERY maily.
7. Error checking and fail conditions are checked in the logic and bugs fixed.
8. Naming, Tagging and references are updated to reflect updated logic.
9. Final polishing was applied using CSS.
10. Code was refactored and restested.
11. Few more features were added and old features are optimized.
12. Final code was uploaded to github


## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The finished project is present in a single index.html page mad up of html, styling and javascript sections. Local Storage was employed as placeholder for values in this project.
